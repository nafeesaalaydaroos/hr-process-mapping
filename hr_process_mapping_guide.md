# HR Process Mapping Guide

This guide provides a simple framework for improving HR processes using visual tools like flowcharts, swimlane diagrams, and 'As-Is / To-Be' comparisons.

## Step-by-Step

1. Identify the HR process (e.g. Onboarding, Appraisals, Exit Interview).
2. Draw the current process ('As-Is') using diagrams or flowcharts.
3. Highlight bottlenecks or delays.
4. Design the improved version ('To-Be') with better alignment or automation.
5. Assign ownership and metrics for each stage.
